discord bot for my friends' and I's server

Nothing fancy, just a little project to integrate some fun commands into our discord server
these commands are as follows:
    watchlist username
        takes a letterboxd username and webscrapes for the watchlist of the user
    watchlist_pool username1,username2,...
        takes a list of letterboxd usernames separated by a comma and webscrapes for the watchlist of the users
    random_watchlist username
        webscrapes for the watchlist, then returns a random movie
    random_watchlist_pool username1,username2,...
        webscrapes a multiple users letterboxd watchlists then prints a random movie, ensuring no duplicates are present in the original watchlist
